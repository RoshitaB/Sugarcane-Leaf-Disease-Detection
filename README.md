# Sugarcane-Leaf-Disease-Detection

This project allows the detection of abnormalities that maybe present on the leaves of the Sugarcane plant and classify/recognize the disease accordingly. 

### Dataset:
* Created by visiting a local sugarcane farm and collecting on-ground images.
* It consists of **224 images** of healthy and diseased crop leaves
* The dataset has 3 classes - **Healthy**, **Red Rot**, **Red Rust**. 
  * **Healthy:** 75 Images
  * **Red Rot:**Â 74 Images
  * **Red Rust:** 75 Images

### Methodology:
Transfer Learning approach was implemented with the help of DenseNet201 architecture. To improve the accuracy of the model, Support Vector Machine (SVM) was incorporated in the final layer of the model. An accuracy of 98% and a validation accuracy of up to 97.78% was obtained.
